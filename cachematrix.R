## Assignment 2 - Caching matrix inversion
## R Programming - rprog-004
##
## Consists of 2 functions - one for getting & setting the cached matrix,
## the other for performing the actual matrix inversion.
##

## makeCacheMatrix
## This creates the matrix object to be inverted

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve
## Checks to see if the solution already exists - if so, return cached,
## if not, then solve & cache solution.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
